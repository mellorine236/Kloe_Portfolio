# Propensity-Model
## Background

Vancity is launching a marketing campaign to increase the number of Registered Retirement Savings Plan (RRSP) joiners by sending direct mails to its current customer base. Direct mails yields response rate that is 10 to 30 times higher than email. However, untargeted promotions reached many uninterested customers which is costly for the environment. Therefore, this cross-selling campaign would greatly benefit from a predictive model that can predict customerâ€™s propensity to purchase in order to create a more targeted campaign.

## Objectives

Identify non-RRSP holding Vancity members who have the greatest potential of enrolling in RRSP.
Increase RRSP volumes and new investment dollars.
Maximize targeting efficiencies and minimize campaign costs.
